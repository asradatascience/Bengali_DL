# Bengali_DL
Basic Motive: Apply DL techniques, transfer learning to classify the Bengali alphabets in the images
Step 1: Replicated Murali Training code
Step 2: Loaded his model using .pth file and created a counter to calculate the accuracy. (To understand how well the model is performing)
Step 3: Learnt about Dataset class in pytorch, will transfer learning using different pretrained models.
